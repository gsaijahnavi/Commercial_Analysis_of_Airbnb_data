# Commercial Analysis of Airbnb
The Airbnb Commercial Analysis project presents an in-depth examination of the United States of America(USA) & Australia’s housing rental market and shines light on the different challenges related with the proliferation of Airbnb and other short-term rental firms.

## Problem Statement
Airbnb’s home sharing is frequently called a "Mom & Pop” arrangement where spare rooms are made available in a house when the resident is already living there. However, through recent revelations from Murray Cox’s Inside Airbnb data, it was observed that in many towns/cities, the majority of listings are investor-owned properties or “whole house rentals”, where the host rents out more than one house on site or rents them out for longer than the legal threshold. The focus has changed from "Mom & Pop" to corporate investors encroaching on residential areas. There is no data transparency when it comes to knowing about which listings are commercial. While Airbnb was started to let tourists travel like locals, it now seems that travellers/users are oblivious to the many facts about the platform’s commercial activities


## Methodology
To answer Airbnb’s commercialization problem, our team created 9 dashboards to showcase several commercial metrics across country-state-county-city levels. These dashboards are made for two countries, namely, the USA and Australia. Although dashboards for both the countries are similar, there is variation of colour tones to change the look and feel.

The dashboards have features such as choropleth maps that indicate revenue density per listing for each of the states, drill down functionality to go up to the city level and compare metrics, licensing requirements and several other interesting visualisations. These are scalable dashboards that allow the user to visualise metrics for any country with just a click over the dashboard. To add more countries there is an option to replace/append the file with corresponding dataset. To ease this process, a scalable python script is provided to clean the data and give out a clean excel datasheet.

Dashboards are segregated in two broad categories: Country-State-County-City level dashboards that provide general overview of the various commercialization metrics, and host behaviour dashboards that specifically focus on metrics answering questions about the hosts’ activities, nature and investments across Airbnb.

## Metrics computed on dashboards

### Assumptions:

● Single listings correspond to hosts that have only one listing across Airbnb

● Multi listings correspond to hosts that have more than one listing across Airbnb

● Short Term Rentals (STRs) are listings rented out for less than 30 days

● Long Term Rentals (LTRs) are listings rented out either 30 or more days

● If a place has even 1% of listings that are licensed then it indicates that the location has a licensing system in place. Otherwise, no licensing system exists.

### Commercialization Metrics used in the dashboard

1. % Listings by Room Type = Count of listings by each room type / Total number of listings

2. % Entire Home by Rent Frequency = Number of Entire Home listings by each rent frequency type / Total number of Entire Home listings

3. % Entire Hosts by Listing Type = Number of Hosts of Entire Home by each listing type / Total number of host of Entire Home

4. % Listing by Segmentation = Number of listing by each commercial segmentation / Total number of listings

5. % Revenue by Segmentation = Revenue by each commercial segmentation / Total revenue amount


### ** Definitions:
* Room Type includes Entire Homes/Apt & Rooms(Private/Shared)

* Rent Frequency has 3 categories : Rented Full time (listings rented for > 90 days)
Semi-regularly rented (listings rented for 30-90 days) &
Occasionally rented (listings rented for < 30 days)

* Listing Type includes Single (One listing per host) & Multi (More than 1 listing per host)

* Commercial Segmentation has 6 divisions in 3 major brackets:
 Commercial ( Listings described as >1 home, 1 home - rented full time, >1 room), Semi-commercial ( Listings described as 1 home - semi regularly rented), Home-sharing (Listings described as 1 home - occasionally rented, 1 room)

#### Host Behavior Metrics used in the dashboard

* % Listings by Classification = Number of listings in each classification / Total listings

* % Listings by Revenue = Revenue generated by each classification / Total Revenue

* Host Count by Classification = Total number of hosts in each classification

* % Running Total of Number of Hosts = Running total of number of hosts / Total number of host ( hosts are distributed by the revenue in a descending order)

* % Running Total of listings = Running total of listings of hosts / total listings

* % Running Total of Revenue = Running total of revenue of hosts / total revenue
